This is triggered when user-supplied input is not properly validated while handling specially crafted data. This can allow a remote attacker to cause a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service, or potentially allowing the [execution of arbitrary code](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-JSON-20209).\n\n## Details\nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## References\n- http://rubysec.com/advisories/OSVDB-101157\n",

When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem tricked into creating Ruby symbols in a target system.\n\n## Details\n\nWhen parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem can be coerced in to creating Ruby symbols in a target system.  Since Ruby symbols are not garbage collected, this can result in a denial of service attack.\n\nThe same technique can be used to create objects in a target system that act like internal objects.  These \"act alike\" objects can be used to bypass certain security mechanisms and can be used as a spring board for SQL injection attacks in Ruby on Rails.\n\nImpacted code looks like this:\n```js\nJSON.parse(user_input)\n```\nWhere the `user_input` variable will have a JSON document like this:\n```json\n{\"json_class\":\"foo\"}\n```\nThe JSON gem will attempt to look up the constant \"foo\".  Looking up this constant will create a symbol.\n\nIn JSON version 1.7.x, objects with arbitrary attributes can be created using JSON documents like this:\n```json\n{\"json_class\":\"JSON::GenericObject\",\"foo\":\"bar\"}\n```\nThis document will result in an instance of `JSON::GenericObject`, with the attribute \"foo\" that has the value \"bar\".  Instantiating these objects will result in arbitrary symbol creation and in some cases can be used to bypass security measures.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this behavior *does not change* when using `JSON.load`.  `JSON.load` should *never* be given input from unknown sources.  If you are processing JSON from an unknown source, *always* use `JSON.parse`.\n\n## References\n- https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/22/json-dos-cve-2013-0269/\n- https://gist.github.com/rsierra/4943505\n",

The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `redis-store` to version 1.4.0 or higher.\n\n## References\n- [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000248)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-store/pull/290)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-store/issues/289)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-store/commit/e0c1398d54a9661c8c70267c3a925ba6b192142e)\n",

Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\n\nOne popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.\n\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.\n\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n\n* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n\n* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example,  [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)\n\n## References\n- http://rubysec.com/advisories/OSVDB-101157\n",

When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem tricked into creating Ruby symbols in a target system.\n\n## Details\n\nWhen parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem can be coerced in to creating Ruby symbols in a target system.  Since Ruby symbols are not garbage collected, this can result in a denial of service attack.\n\nThe same technique can be used to create objects in a target system that act like internal objects.  These \"act alike\" objects can be used to bypass certain security mechanisms and can be used as a spring board for SQL injection attacks in Ruby on Rails.\n\nImpacted code looks like this:\n```js\nJSON.parse(user_input)\n```\nWhere the `user_input` variable will have a JSON document like this:\n```json\n{\"json_class\":\"foo\"}\n```\nThe JSON gem will attempt to look up the constant \"foo\".  Looking up this constant will create a symbol.\n\nIn JSON version 1.7.x, objects with arbitrary attributes can be created using JSON documents like this:\n```json\n{\"json_class\":\"JSON::GenericObject\",\"foo\":\"bar\"}\n```\nThis document will result in an instance of `JSON::GenericObject`, with the attribute \"foo\" that has the value \"bar\".  Instantiating these objects will result in arbitrary symbol creation and in some cases can be used to bypass security measures.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this behavior *does not change* when using `JSON.load`.  `JSON.load` should *never* be given input from unknown sources.  If you are processing JSON from an unknown source, *always* use `JSON.parse`.\n\n## References\n- https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/22/json-dos-cve-2013-0269/\n- https://gist.github.com/rsierra/4943505\n",

The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `redis-store` to version 1.4.0 or higher.\n\n## References\n- [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000248)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-store/pull/290)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-store/issues/289)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-store/commit/e0c1398d54a9661c8c70267c3a925ba6b192142e)\n",

When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem tricked into creating Ruby symbols in a target system.\n\n## Details\n\nWhen parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem can be coerced in to creating Ruby symbols in a target system.  Since Ruby symbols are not garbage collected, this can result in a denial of service attack.\n\nThe same technique can be used to create objects in a target system that act like internal objects.  These \"act alike\" objects can be used to bypass certain security mechanisms and can be used as a spring board for SQL injection attacks in Ruby on Rails.\n\nImpacted code looks like this:\n```js\nJSON.parse(user_input)\n```\nWhere the `user_input` variable will have a JSON document like this:\n```json\n{\"json_class\":\"foo\"}\n```\nThe JSON gem will attempt to look up the constant \"foo\".  Looking up this constant will create a symbol.\n\nIn JSON version 1.7.x, objects with arbitrary attributes can be created using JSON documents like this:\n```json\n{\"json_class\":\"JSON::GenericObject\",\"foo\":\"bar\"}\n```\nThis document will result in an instance of `JSON::GenericObject`, with the attribute \"foo\" that has the value \"bar\".  Instantiating these objects will result in arbitrary symbol creation and in some cases can be used to bypass security measures.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: this behavior *does not change* when using `JSON.load`.  `JSON.load` should *never* be given input from unknown sources.  If you are processing JSON from an unknown source, *always* use `JSON.parse`.\n\n## References\n- https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/22/json-dos-cve-2013-0269/\n- https://gist.github.com/rsierra/4943505\n",

The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `redis-store` to version 1.4.0 or higher.\n\n## References\n- [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000248)\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-store/pull/290)\n- [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-store/issues/289)\n- [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-store/commit/e0c1398d54a9661c8c70267c3a925ba6b192142e)\n",
